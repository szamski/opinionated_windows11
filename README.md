# Opinionated Windows 11 Setup

![Fastfetch Screenshot](assets/fastfetch.png)

Who said Windows 11 can't have dotfiles? Who said you can't have a proper terminal with fuzzy finder, starship, fastfetch, ffmpeg, and all the good stuff?

Nobody. That's who.

## Why This Exists

This script is for people like me—people stuck on Windows for reasons beyond their control. Maybe it's your company's MS Office infrastructure. Maybe it's security policies. Maybe it's just... work.

But you still want a properly configured system. You want to code in Node.js or Python without friction. You want those Linux niceties: beautiful terminal prompts, modern CLI tools, `neovim` with LazyVim, and all that good stuff.

I got tired of the Windows setup dance—clicking through installers, downloading files one by one, configuring settings manually. It's absurdly tedious compared to Linux. So I made this: **one command to get everything set up**.

**Important:** You won't find window manager wannabes like GlazeWM here trying to be "almost as good as Hyprland." Let's not kid ourselves—this is still Windows, with all its quirks. But it's Windows with way more advantages than a typical installation.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### One Command, That's It

Open PowerShell as Administrator:

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/szamski/Omawin/main/setup.ps1 | iex
```

The script will:
1. Clone itself to your machine
2. Show you an interactive menu
3. Let you choose what to install
4. Get out of your way

**Note:** You need Git installed. If you don't have it, the script will tell you what to do.

### Or Clone First (If You're That Type)

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/szamski/Omawin.git
cd Omawin
.\setup.ps1
```

## ✨ What You Get

```powershell
# Search winget
winget search "whatever you want"

# Search Microsoft Store
winget search "app name" --source msstore

# Search Scoop
scoop search "package"
```

### Modify System Settings
Edit `scripts/configure-system.ps1` for different registry tweaks.

### Adjust Privacy Settings

### Customize PowerShell Profile
After installation, edit your profile:
```powershell
code $PROFILE
```

### Modify Starship Prompt

This is your machine. Make it yours.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**Winget not found?**
Install "App Installer" from Microsoft Store. Restart PowerShell.

**Permission denied?**
Run PowerShell as Administrator. Right-click, "Run as Administrator."

**Execution policy blocking?**
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

**WSL installation failed?**
Enable Virtualization in BIOS. Some features require a restart.

**Scoop installation issues?**
Check execution policy and ensure you have internet access.

**Git SSH key not working?**
Add the generated key to GitHub: https://github.com/settings/keys
